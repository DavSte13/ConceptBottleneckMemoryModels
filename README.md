# CBMCleaned

Cleaned version of the ConceptBottleneck repository of https://github.com/yewsiang/ConceptBottleneck.

The requirements.txt file might not be fully up to date. 

Steps before usage:
Download the CUB_2011_200 dataset (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/datasets/cub_200_2011/) and have it as a folder in the main directory.
Possible (but not necessary): Download the pretrained Inception model from https://worksheets.codalab.org/worksheets/0x362911581fcd4e048ddfd84f47203fd2.

The OAI part of the Repo is not cleaned so far, the adverserial robustness examples are also not tested.
